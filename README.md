Libra_Buildup...

This program is used to real-time monitor the pulse train of Libraâ€™s regenerative amplifier from any type of Tektronix oscilloscope and alarm if the build-up trace fall down the selected threshold.

Note: Oscilloscope interface communication can be done either with GPIB or RS232. 
For RS232 communication, higher baud rate (19200 bit/s) with hardware handshaking flow control need to be used to eliminate any data loss.
